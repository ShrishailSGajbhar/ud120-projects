I decided to refresh and test my knowledge of core ML concepts and took ud120, a free audit course by Udacity. I Had a lot of fun while solving the quizzes and implementing mini projects. Here is the repository for my solutions to quizzes and mini projects for Udacity's "Introduction to Machine Learning" (ud120).

The main problem that I faced was regarding the python version. Since the course was offered nearly a 5 to 6 years ago, it used python 2.7 version for developement.
Here are the steps that I did:
* Creating a virtual environment with python 2.7 as the default version by using "mkvirtualenv -p python2 udacity-ml"
* The above command will create a virtual environment named "udacity-ml" with python 2 as the default python version.
* For above command to work you require to install **virtualenvwrapper** which has "mkvirtualenv" command.
* **virtualenvwrapper** makes life easier by providing various commands to manage the virtual environments with great ease.
